# TensorFlow Models Training
A collection of scripts to train TensorFlow models.
These scripts are created to support datasets that are originally in Pascal VOC format.
However, it is possible to use other object detection dataset formats as long as we can 
convert them into TFRecord format.

We assume Pascal VOC format from now onward.
